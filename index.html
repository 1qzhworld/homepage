                When agents become unreliable, adversarial agents may take control of the network. I am interested in developing robust algorithms urgently needed for current research, particularly in distributed scenarios, including both fully distributed and federated learning, as well as online and offline environments.

        <h2> Biography </h2>
        <p>Zhihai Qu received his B.S. degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Hefei University of Technology, Anhui, China, in 2017, and his Master's degree in Communication and Information Systems from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, under the supervision of 
            <a href="https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/lujie/">Prof. Jie Lu</a> in 2020.
            After that, he joined Hithink Royal Flush Info. Network Co. as an algorithm developer, focusing on federated learning algorithm development, before leaving in 2021. He is now expected to complete his Ph.D. in Control Science and Engineering at Tongji University, China, under the supervision of 
            <a href="https://see.tongji.edu.cn/info/1377/10313.htm"> Prof. Li Li</a>, with co-supervisors 
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/xiuxianli">Prof. Xiuxian Li</a> and 
            <a href="http://lsc.amss.ac.cn/~yghong/">Prof. Yiguang Hong</a>, in December 2024.
        
        His research interests include, but are not limited to, developing algorithms for distributed optimization, federated learning, and online optimization problems, with a particular focus on the security issues therein.</p>
            
        <p>Zhihai is highly self-motivated and capable of working both independently and collaboratively with his colleagues. He enjoys engaging in discussions with people from various fields and excels at asking questions, often leading to new topics for future research. Zhihai has a strong reputation among colleagues from diverse perspectives. However, he is not without flaws; sometimes, he spends too much time on a single area in his quest to satisfy his curiosity. When this happens, a stop button should be pressed.</p>

        <p>After working in the company, where he was also an algorithm developer, he believes that he is still passionate about doing more interesting and realistic research. He believes that solely publishing more work may not make the world better, but good work can. Academic research and practical implementation are both important for the world. Currently, he is seeking a postdoctoral position.</p>
